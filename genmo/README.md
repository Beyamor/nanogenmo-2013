# NaNoGenMo 2013
A bit of work on a [NaNoGenMo](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo) project.

The big idea was modelling a narrative as a series of events. Some events required certain conditions to be met before they could occur; the story was then realized by inserting additional events to satisfy these conditions. For example, a travel event satisfies the condition that certain characters be in a certain event.

I, uh, didn't get very far.
